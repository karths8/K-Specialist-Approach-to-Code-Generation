[Question 2]

Given a grid of integers, your task is to determine if there exists a valid submatrix in the grid such that the sum of elements in the submatrix does not exceed a given threshold. A valid submatrix can be formed by selecting a group of cells in the grid where no two selected cells are adjacent in the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Return True if such a valid submatrix exists, and False otherwise.

[Question 2]

You are given a list of integers. Write a function `computeXOR` to compute the XOR of all the edge lengths of a permutation of the given list using the divide and conquer approach.

The edge lengths are formed by taking XOR of adjacent elements in the permutation.

For example, given the list [1, 2, 3], the permutations are [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1]. The edge lengths for each permutation are [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], [2, 1], and [1, 1] respectively. The XOR of these edge lengths is 0.

[Question 1]

Given an array of positive integers, we need to check if the sum of the count of digits of the array elements is a prime number or not. Return True if the sum is prime, otherwise return False.

For example, with the array [12, 34, 56, 78], the count of digits are 2, 2, 2, and 2 respectively, and when we sum them, we get 8. 8 is not a prime number, so the function should return False.

Given a positive integer 'num', write a function to determine whether 'num' is a "Full Fibonacci" number. A number is considered a "Full Fibonacci" if it can be represented as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. If 'num' is a Full Fibonacci number, return True; otherwise, return False.

A Full Fibonacci number is defined as a number that can be expressed as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:  
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1  
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

For example, 21 is a Full Fibonacci number because it can be represented as F(8) + F(5) + F(3).

You are given an array of integers representing the discounts available on a set of products. The task is to check if it is possible to apply the discounts in such a way that the total discount becomes zero. Furthermore, the order of the discounts can be changed, and each discount can be split and merged with others to achieve the total discount of zero.

For example, for the array [10, 20, 30], it is possible to re-order and merge the discounts to achieve a total discount of zero by applying the following operations:
Order: [10, 20, 30]
Split 30 into 10 and 20, merge 10 with the existing 10 to make 20, and merge 20 with the existing 20 to make 40

You are given a chemical equation as a string, and you need to balance the chemical equation by finding the correct coefficients of each chemical compound. Write a program to balance the given chemical equation. A balanced chemical equation has the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. For example, the unbalanced equation: "H2 + O2 = H2O" can be balanced by adding a coefficient of 2 to H2, making it 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O.

[Question 1]

The task is to find the integral of a given function using Boole's Rule. Boole's Rule is a numerical integration method to approximate the definite integral of a function. Given the function f(x) and the integration limits a and b, the integral can be approximated using Boole's Rule.

Boole's Rule states that for n=4, the approximation for the integral ∫[a,b] f(x) dx is given by:

\[ I = \frac{2h}{45} * [7f(a) + 32f(a+h) + 12f(a+2h) + 32f(a+3h) + 7f(b)] \]

where h = (b-a)/4 is the step size, and f(x) is the given function. 

Write a function to find the integral of the given function using Boole's Rule by taking the function f(x), the integration limits a and b as input.

[Question 2]

Write a function to perform numerical integration using the binary search method to find the focus of a given Pascal function. The Pascal function is defined as:

\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1 \\ f(x-1) + f(x-2) & \text{if } x > 1 \end{cases} \]

The focus of a function is the value of x for which the function achieves its maximum value. In this case, we want to find the focus within a given range of limits a and b by using the binary search method to approximate the integral of the Pascal function and identify the x value at which the function reaches its maximum.

Write a function that takes the limits a and b as input and approximates the focus of the Pascal function within the given range using the binary search method and numerical integration.

[Question 2]

You are given an array of integers and you need to find the minimum cost of converting the array into a mirror array. A mirror array is an array that reads the same forwards and backwards. The cost of converting an element in the array is the absolute difference between the original element and the new integer that it is converted to. You can only perform insertions into the array to convert it into a mirror array. You also need to ensure that the width of the array remains constant after the insertions.

Write a function minMirrorCost() that takes an array arr, its size N, and returns the minimum cost to convert the array into a mirror array.

For example:
Given arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2] the minimum cost of converting the array into a mirror array is 3. One possible way to achieve this cost is by inserting 2 at the start and 5 at the end of the array to make it [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2] which reads the same forwards and backwards.

Given two integers L and R, the task is to find the sum of product of proper divisors of all numbers lying in the range [L, R].

A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is less than the number itself.

For example:
- The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.
- The proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

You are required to find the sum of product of all proper divisors of each number in the range [L, R].

[Question 2]

A bitonic sequence is a sequence of numbers that first increases and then decreases. Given a range of integers from L to R, write a recursive function to find the sum of product of proper divisors of all bitonic numbers in the range.

For example:
- In the range [10, 20], the bitonic numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
- The proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5.
- The proper divisors of 13 are 1.
- The proper divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- The sum of product of proper divisors of bitonic numbers in the range [10, 20] would be 1*2*5 + 1 + 1*2*4*5 = 54.

An edge swap is an operation that replaces two intersecting edges with two non-intersecting edges, effectively changing the graph's embedding on the plane.

Write a function to calculate the number of regions in the planar graph after performing a given number of edge swaps.

[/Question 2]

[Code 2]

def num_of_regions_after_swaps(vertices: int, edges: int, swaps: int) -> int:
    regions = edges - vertices + 1  # Calculate initial number of regions
    regions += swaps  # Each swap adds one region
    return regions

[/Code 2]

[Question 1]

You are given the coordinates (x, y, z) of a point in a 3D space. Write a program to determine which octant the point lies in with respect to the axial plane. The octants are numbered from 1 to 8 as shown in the figure below:

```
       2      |      1
   ---------------------
       3      |      4

       6      |      5
   ---------------------
       7      |      8
```

A point is said to belong to an octant if its x, y, and z coordinates are all positive or all negative. If any of the coordinates are zero, return -1 to indicate that the point lies on an axis. 

Write a function called `octant_of_axial_plane` to determine the octant of a given point and return the corresponding octant number or -1 if the point lies on an axis.

The function should take in three parameters:
- `x` : an integer representing the x-coordinate of the point
- `y` : an integer representing the y-coordinate of the point
- `z` : an integer representing the z-coordinate of the point

You are given a matrix of size N x M containing integers. You can flip the sign of any adjacent pair of elements (adjacent pairs refer to horizontally or vertically adjacent elements). The task is to maximize the sum of the matrix so that it has the largest possible sum after flipping the sign.

For example, given the matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]

One possible solution is to flip the signs of the pair (3, 6), resulting in the maximum sum of 42.

[Question 1]

Given a positive integer N, find two proper factors of N such that their sum is coprime with N. A proper factor of a number is a factor other than 1 and the number itself. Coprime numbers are numbers which have no common factors other than 1.

Write a function to find and return the two proper factors as a pair, or return an empty list if no such pair exists.

For example, given N = 12. The proper factors of 12 are [2, 3, 4, 6]. The pairs with their sums are [(2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 7), (6, 7)], and the pairs with coprime sums are [(2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 5, (6, 7)]. Therefore, the function should return any one of these pairs.

You need to find out how many additional instances are needed at the end of the time frame if the following conditions are met:
1. If the average workload is less than or equal to 1, you do not perform scaling, so the number of instances remains constant.
2. If the average workload is more than 1 but less than or equal to 2, you can add one more instance.
3. If the average workload is more than 2, you can add enough instances to bring the total to twice the current number of instances.

Write a function to find the additional instances needed at the end of the time frame.

[Question 2]

You are given a binary tree and 'q' queries to update the tree by either adding or multiplying the values of nodes at specific indices and print the updated value at the specified index. The tree is represented as an array where the value at index 'i' is the value of the node at the 'i-th' level of a complete binary tree.

There are two types of queries:
Type 1: Add 'x' to the value at index 'idx' (1-based indexing)
Type 2: Multiply the value at index 'idx' with 'x' (1-based indexing)

Write a function to handle 'q' queries and print the updated value for each query.

[Question 2]

Given a set of binary numbers, write a program to find the number of pairs of elements in the set such that their bitwise AND is non-zero and forms an asymmetric relation.

An asymmetric relation is a binary relation on a set for which it is not the case that if a is related to b, then b is related to a. In other words, a relation R on a set X is asymmetric if (a, b) ∈ R implies that (b, a) ∉ R for all a, b ∈ X.

Given two numbers as linked lists where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order, write a function to compare the two numbers. Return 1 if the first number is greater, -1 if the second number is greater, and 0 if both numbers are equal.

For example, if the input linked lists are `2 -> 4 -> 3` and `5 -> 6 -> 4`, then the first number is 342 and the second number is 465. Since 465 is greater than 342, the function should return -1.

Write a function to swap the positions of two nodes in a linked list. The function should take the linked list and the positions of the nodes to be swapped as input and return the updated linked list. Assume that the positions are 1-indexed and the positions are inclusive, meaning both nodes at the given positions should be swapped.

For example, if the linked list is 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 9 -> 5 and the positions to swap are 2 and 4, then after swapping, the linked list should be 3 -> 9 -> 4 -> 7 -> 5.

For example, if the input array is [3, 5, 8, 10, 15], the output should be 8, as the maximum bitwise AND value is obtained by selecting the odd number 3 and the Lucas sequence number 5, giving us 1 using bitwise AND.

Given an array of N elements. The Recaman Sequence or Recaman's Sequence is a mathematical sequence defined as follows:

- The first term is 0.
- From the nth term onwards, the term is derived as follows. If the previous term (n-1) is greater than n and the result of (n-1) - n is not already there in the sequence, then the current term is previous term minus n. Otherwise, the current term is the previous term plus n.

The task is to find the minimum number of elements of the array to be changed into a new value so that the final array forms Recaman's Sequence.

Given a set of distinct points and a value of x for which the value of y is to be found, the task is to implement Inverse Interpolation using Lagrange Formula to find the value of y.

Lagrange's interpolation formula is given by:

\[y = \sum_{j=0}^{n} y_{j} \prod_{0<=m<=n,m!=j} \frac{(x - x_{m})}{(x_{j} - x_{m})}\]

Where,
- \( n \) is the degree of the polynomial.
- \( (x_{0}, y_{0}), (x_{1}, y_{1}), ..., (x_{n}, y_{n}) \) are n+1 distinct points.

The above formula can be used to find y given x. The inverse interpolation would be using the same formula as above but to find x given y. 

Write a function to implement the inverse interpolation using the Lagrange formula to find the value of x given y.

You are given a range [L, R] from which you need to find the sum of the greatest odd divisors of each number in the given range.

Write a function that takes in two integers L and R and returns the sum of the greatest odd divisors for each number in the given range.

For example, given the range [3, 7], the greatest odd divisors for the numbers in the range are:
- For 3: 3 (as 3 is a prime number and the greatest odd divisor of a prime number is itself)
- For 4: 1 (as the odd divisors of 4 are 1 and 4 and the greatest odd divisor is 1)
- For 5: 5 (as 5 is a prime number and the greatest odd divisor of a prime number is itself)
- For 6: 3 (as the odd divisors of 6 are 1, 3 and 6 and the greatest odd divisor is 3)
- For 7: 7 (as 7 is a prime number and the greatest odd divisor of a prime number is itself)

Therefore, the sum of the greatest odd divisors in the range [3, 7] is 3 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 19.

You are given a set of complex numbers. You need to group these complex numbers into two different groups based on a certain algorithm. In each group, you need to find the largest number that could be formed from the digits of the real part of the complex numbers, and then check if the largest number is divisible by 3.

Write a function `largestDivisibleComplexNumber` to perform this task. The function should take a list of complex numbers and return a boolean value indicating if both groups contain a number that is divisible by 3.

For example:
If the given set of complex numbers is {3+7j, 5+12j, 8+4j, 6-2j}, the real parts are [3, 5, 8, 6]. The largest numbers that could be formed are 8536 and 612. Only 8536 is divisible by 3, so the function should return False.

Iteration 1: 
n = 1
Iteration 2: 
n = 11
Iteration 3: 
n = 1111
Sum of digits of final number 1111 = 4

[Question 2]

Write a function to compute the sum of digits of a given number, and then repeatedly perform the same computation on the sum obtained, until the output of the computation becomes a single digit.

For example, if the input number is 598, the process would be as follows:
Iteration 1:
Compute the sum of digits: 5+9+8 = 22
Iteration 2:
Compute the sum of digits of the sum obtained in iteration 1: 2+2 = 4
The output of the computation becomes a single digit (4), so the process stops.

[Question 2]

Develop a program to calculate the margin of error for a sample mean using the standard error and a given confidence level. The margin of error represents the amount of random sampling error in statistical surveys or experiments. It is used to calculate the range in which the true population mean is likely to fall. 

The formula to calculate the margin of error is:

\[ME = Z \times SE\]

Where:
- \(Z\) = the Z-score associated with the confidence level
- \(SE\) = the standard error of the mean.

The Z-score can be calculated using the confidence level and is based on the standard normal distribution.
