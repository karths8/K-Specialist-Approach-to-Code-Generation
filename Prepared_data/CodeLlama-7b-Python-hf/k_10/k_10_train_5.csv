You are given an array of integers representing the cost of glasses. You want to reduce the array to a single element with the minimum possible cost. The cost of combining any two glasses a[i] and a[j] into a single glass is a[i] + a[j]. Additionally, after combining two glasses, the cost of the resulting glass will be the sum of the costs of the original two glasses.

Write a function to find the minimum cost to reduce the array to a single glass.

[Question]
        
You are given an array of N integers. The task is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that the absolute difference between the indices is the same as the absolute difference between their values.

For example, in the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4], the subsequence (1, 2, 3) has the absolute difference between the indices (2-1 = 1, 3-2 = 1) equal to the absolute difference between their values (2-1 = 1, 3-2 = 1), so it forms a valid subsequence.

[Question]
        
You are given a 2D array and a set of queries. Each query consists of two integers L and R. The task is to find the subarray within the range L to R inclusive that maximizes the difference between the minimum and the odd occurrences of elements in the subarray. The difference is calculated for consecutive elements in the subarray.

Given an array of non-negative integers, your task is to implement an algorithm to minimize the length of the array by replacing any two adjacent elements with their sum. The contribution of odd digits in the infinite sum should be minimized. Return the length of the resulting array after performing the replacements.

Given an array of integers and a number K, find the minimum value of the expression which can be obtained by choosing exactly K elements from the array. The expression is given by (x1 + x2)^2 + (x3 + x4)^2 + … + (x2*K-1 + x2*K)^2, where x1, x2, ... x2*K are the elements chosen from the array.

You are given an array of scores representing the scores of students in a class. The task is to minimize the sum of prime numbers added to make the array non-decreasing by adding prime numbers minimum 1 to make the array non-decreasing. If the array is already non-decreasing, then the minimum sum is 0.

Write a function minimizeSumOfPrimesScores which takes in the array of scores as input and returns the minimum sum of prime numbers added to make the array non-decreasing.

[Question]
        
Given an array of integers `arr[]` and an integer `K`, the task is to find the minimum number of elements that must be removed from the end of the array such that the sum of the remaining elements is less than or equal to `K`.

Write a function `minRemovals` to accomplish this. The function should accept the array `arr[]` and the integer `K` as input and return the minimum number of elements to be removed.

For example, given `arr[] = [4, 7, 5, 6]` and `K = 20`, the function should return `0`, as the sum of all elements is `22` which is already greater than `K`.

You are given an array of integers and an integer K. The array represents the prices of a stock over K days. The task is to find the minimum number of elements to be subtracted from either end of the array such that the summation of the prices is the minimum possible value, or determine if it is impossible to achieve a minimum summation.
