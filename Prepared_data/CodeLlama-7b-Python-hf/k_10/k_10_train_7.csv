[Question]
        
You are given a list of payment amounts made by customers over a 24-hour period. However, due to a system restriction, some payments were not recorded. Write a function to find the missing payment amounts. Additionally, you need to find the maximum prime factor of any missing payment amount and determine if there are any consecutive digits in those missing amounts that are convertible into a prime number. Return the list of missing payment amounts and their corresponding details.

[Question]
        
You are given a list of integers representing the distance of items from the starting point. Your task is to find the distance covered by an individual to collect items placed at equal distances from each other. If items are placed at every x unit distance, then the total distance covered will be x * (n - 1) where n is the total number of items.

For example, if the distances of items are [3, 6, 9, 12], then the total distance covered will be 3 * 3 = 9 units.

Write a function that takes a list of distances as input and returns the total distance covered by an individual.

[Question]
        
Dixon's Factorization Method is an integer factorization algorithm, which is used to factor long integers by finding non-trivial factors using the formula x^2 ≡ y^2 (mod N), where N is the number to be factored. Implement the Dixon's Factorization Method to find the non-trivial factors of a given number N.

Prime Factorization: Given a positive integer n greater than 1, return a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers: the prime factor and its exponent in the prime factorization of n.

For example, the prime factorization of 18 is 2^1 * 3^2, so the function should return [(2, 1), (3, 2)].

[Question]
        
You have been tasked with implementing a car payment validator function. The function should take in the payment amount and the sum of the payment digits as arguments and return a boolean value indicating whether the payment is valid. A valid payment should satisfy the following conditions:
- The sum of the digits of the payment should be odd.
- The binary representation of the payment amount should have at least one set-bit at the 4th index.
- The payment amount should be a multiple of 90.
- The lambda of the payment amount should be greater than 0.5.
Write the car payment validator function and use logic gates and filtering to check for the specified conditions.

Write a function called `generateGrayCode` which takes in a positive integer N and returns the N-bit Gray code sequence as a list of integers.

assert generateGrayCode(2) == [0, 1, 3, 2]
assert generateGrayCode(1) == [0, 1]

[Question]
        
You are given a positive number \texttt{num}. You can perform successive division of this number by a divisor until the number becomes 0. The task is to find the number after the successive division.

For example, if the number is 100 and the divisor is 2, the successive division would proceed as follows: 100/2=50, 50/2=25, 25/2=12, ..., and so on. The number after the successive division would be 0.

Given a base B and a number N, the task is to find the largest N digit perfect square number in the given base B. A perfect square number is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. Return -1 if there is no perfect square number of N digits in base B.

For example, if B = 10 and N = 2, the largest 2 digit perfect square number is 81 (9 * 9 = 81).

Write a function `largest_perfect_square(B: int, N: int) -> int` to find the largest N digit perfect square number in base B, and return -1 if no such number exists.

[Question]
        
Write a function that takes a list of positive integers and removes all the composite numbers from the list. Then, the function should calculate the sum of all the remaining numbers in the list and return the sum.

For example, given the list [3, 8, 5, 12, 7], the composite numbers are 8 and 12. After removing these numbers, the list becomes [3, 5, 7], and the sum of these numbers is 15.

Write a function named `removeCompositeAndCalculateSum` to solve the problem.

The Fibonacci sequence is characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given a number n, your task is to find the index of the given fibonacci number in constant time i.e. O(1).

Assume the fibonacci series starts from index 0.

You are given a series of integers: 3, 8, 13, 18, 23... and asked to find the Nth number in the series. The series follows a pattern where each number is calculated as 5 * N - 2. Write a program to find the Nth number in the series.

Write a function nth_series_number(N) that takes an integer N as input and returns the Nth number in the given series.

For example, if N = 4, the output will be 18 as it is the 4th term in the series.

assert nth_series_number(2) == 8

[Question]
        
You are given a list of packets, each containing an integer representing the number of items. The packets are currently arranged in an unsafe manner, where the pairwise difference of sequential packets is not following a certain pattern. The task is to re-arrange the packets such that the pairwise difference follows a predefined weighted sum format, similar to the construction method of Pascal's triangle but in a regular hexagon format.

Write a function to re-arrange the packets iteratively such that the pairwise difference of sequential packets follows the weighted sum format as described.
