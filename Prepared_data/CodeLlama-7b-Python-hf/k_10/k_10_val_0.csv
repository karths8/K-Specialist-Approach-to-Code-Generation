The operation is to insert any two-character string in any position of the original string. Your task is to determine if it's feasible to make the bitwise AND of any substring of s equal to 0.

[Question]
        
You are given a string representing a sequence of brackets. You need to write a function to find the Manhattan distance between the first occurrence and the second minimum occurrence of each bracket type in the sequence.

For example, given the string ""({[(){}]})"", the Manhattan distances for each bracket type are calculated as follows:
- For '(', the first occurrence is at index 1 and the second minimum occurrence is at index 2, so the Manhattan distance is |1-2| = 1.
- For '{', the first occurrence is at index 2 and the second minimum occurrence is at index 3, so the Manhattan distance is |2-3| = 1.
- For '[', the first occurrence is at index 3 and the second minimum occurrence is at index 4, so the Manhattan distance is |3-4| = 1.
- For ')', the first occurrence is at index 5 and there is no second minimum occurrence, so the Manhattan distance is 0.
- For '}', the first occurrence is at index 6 and there is no second minimum occurrence, so the Manhattan distance is 0.
- For ']', the first occurrence is at index 7 and there is no second minimum occurrence, so the Manhattan distance is 0.

Write a function that takes in the string representing the sequence of brackets and returns a dictionary where the keys are the bracket types and the values are the Manhattan distances.

[Question]
        
You are given a 3x3 keypad with digits representing letters. Each digit corresponds to a set of letters based on its position in the keypad. For example, the digit '2' may correspond to 'a', 'b', or 'c'. In this scenario, the keypad is damaged, and only the digit complement of the original keypad is available, where the complement of a digit is the digit that occurs in the same row or column but in the opposite direction. For example, the digit complement of '2' is '8' as they occur in the same row but in opposite directions. Write a Python program to decrypt the given cipher text using the digit complement mapping.

Follow the steps below:
1. Create a mapping of the original keypad digits to their corresponding letters based on their position.
2. Create a digit complement mapping for each digit based on its row or column.
3. Use the digit complement mapping to decrypt the given cipher text into the original plaintext.

[Question]
        
Given a set of characters and their corresponding weights, you are required to form words from these characters to maximize the weighted sum of the probabilities of forming each word. The probability of forming a word is calculated based on the individual weights of the characters and the concentration of characters in the input set.

For input = ""abc"", {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.3, 'c': 0.2}, [""aabbcc"", ""abbccc""] the output should be 0.
For input = ""abc"", {'a': 0.4, 'b': 0.3, 'c': 0.3}, [""abc"", ""bca"", ""acb""] the output should be 0.04.
For input = ""abcd"", {'a': 0.2, 'b': 0.3, 'c': 0.1, 'd': 0.4}, [""abcd"", ""dabc"", ""abcd""] the output should be 0.008.
For input = ""xyz"", {'x': 0.5, 'y': 0.3, 'z': 0.2}, [""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi""] the output should be 0.

[Question]
        
You are given a 2D list 'grid' representing a block of characters. Each block has a character and a frequency associated with it. You need to rearrange the characters in each block such that no two same characters are adjacent horizontally or vertically. Given a query block represented by its index (i, j), return the rearranged block after minimizing the cost. The cost is defined as the number of positions the character has to be moved to satisfy the condition.

Write a function to solve the problem.

For input = [[('a',2),('b',1), ('a',1)], [('b',3),('a',1), ('b',2)]], 1, 2 the output should be [.
For input = [[('a',2),('b',1)], [('b',3),('a',1)]], 0, 0 the output should be [('a', 2), ('b', 1)].
