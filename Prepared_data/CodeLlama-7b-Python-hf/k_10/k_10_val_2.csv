[Question]
        
Write a program to calculate the distance between a given point and a plane in 3D. The distance between a point P(x, y, z) and a plane Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 is given by |Ax + By + Cz + D| / sqrt(A² + B² + C²). Using this formula, find the distance between the plane and the given point, and return the result.
