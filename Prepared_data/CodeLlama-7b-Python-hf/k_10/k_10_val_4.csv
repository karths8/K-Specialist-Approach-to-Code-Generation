You are given a rectangular park represented as a grid of size m x n. Each cell in the grid represents a tile, and the goal is to determine if the park can be completely linked by arranging tiles with even parity. The conditions for linking the park completely include ensuring that each row and each column in the park has an even number of tiles. Write a function to solve this puzzle by determining if the given instance of the park is solvable under the given conditions. Return True if the park can be completely linked with tiles of even parity, otherwise return False.
