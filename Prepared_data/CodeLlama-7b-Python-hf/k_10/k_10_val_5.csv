You are given an unsorted array of integers. Write a function to find the length of the shortest subarray that, when sorted, results in the entire array being sorted.

For example, given the input [1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 7], the output should be 4, as sorting the subarray from index 1 to 4 (3, 5, 2, 6) would result in the entire array being sorted.

You are given an array of positive integers. Write a function to minimize the sum of the array by performing the following operation: for each element in the array, divide it by 2 if it is even, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until the array converges to a point where all elements are 1. Return the minimized sum of the array.
