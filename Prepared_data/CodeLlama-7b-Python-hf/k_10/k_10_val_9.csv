[Question]
        
Given an array of integers, the task is to find the minimum number of increment operations required to make all array elements equal. However, you are allowed to remove exactly one of the elements from the array. The sum of the remaining elements should be equal to the original sum of the entire array.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 5, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove 5 from the array and all other elements will become equal to 2.
