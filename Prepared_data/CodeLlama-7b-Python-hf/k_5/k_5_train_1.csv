Given the positions of a Bishop and a Pawn on a chess board, determine whether the Bishop can capture the Pawn or not. The Bishop moves any number of squares diagonally and has the ability to capture the Pawn if it's present on a square to which the Bishop can move.

Write a function that takes in the positions of Bishop and Pawn as strings, converts them into coordinates, and then checks if the Bishop can capture the Pawn or not. Return True if the Bishop can capture the Pawn, else return False.

You are given a 2D plane with N squares defined by their centers at (x[i], y[i]) and side-lengths s[i]. You need to write a recursive function to determine if there is a point inside exactly K squares with both its coordinates being even digits.

Write a recursive function that takes in the information of the N squares, the value of K, and returns True if there exists a point satisfying the given conditions, and False otherwise. You may assume that all coordinates are integers.

You are given a list of coordinates representing a path and you need to determine if the movement between each pair of coordinates is uniform, i.e., the distance covered in each step is the same. Implement a function to check if the movement between coordinates is uniform. Return True if it is uniform, otherwise return False.

Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times: Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.

A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.

[Question]
        
You are given an undirected graph without weights but with N vertices and M edges. Your task is to check whether it is possible to visit every node exactly once with the following conditions: 
1. The starting and ending node is the same. 
2. No node should be visited twice except the starting and ending node. 

If it is possible, return True otherwise return False.

Given a sorted array of integers arr[], the task is to measure if there exists a pair of elements such that the ceil of the division of one element by the power of 2 results in the other element. If such a pair exists, return True; otherwise, return False.

Write a function that takes in a sorted array and checks if such a pair exists using a greedy approach with bitwise operations.

Pattern Matching: You are given a pattern and a string. Your task is to determine if the string follows the same pattern.

For example:
- pattern = ""abba""
- str = ""dog cat cat dog""
The pattern follows the same structure and str is ""dog cat cat dog"", so the output should be True.

Implement a function that takes a pattern and a string as input and returns True if the string follows the same pattern, and False otherwise.

patternMatching(""a"", ""dog"") = True
patternMatching(""abba"", ""dog cat cat dog"") = True
patternMatching(""ab"", ""dog dog"") = False

You are given a rooted tree with N nodes where each node contains a special character. Write a program to determine if it is possible to rotate a single branch of the tree 180 degrees such that no special character is repeated on any edge. You can use the Sparse Table data structure to efficiently answer the queries related to subtree identifications.

You are given a list of numbers. You are asked to find an optimal subset such that the subset forms a Reuleaux triangle when plotted on a 2D plane. A subset forms a Reuleaux triangle if any three distinct points in the subset form a Reuleaux triangle. Return True if such a subset exists, otherwise return False.

Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)]
Output: F

Write an algorithm to check if a given array contains a boolean subsequence that is strictly increasing in length (i.e., the length of the subsequence increases as you move through the array) and the sequence of elements are all separated by whitespace.

For example, given the array [True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False], the subsequence ""False True True"" is strictly increasing in length and separated by whitespace, so the algorithm should return True.

Write a function that takes in an array and returns True if such a subsequence exists, and False otherwise.

>>> containsIncreasingWhitespaceSubsequence([False, True, True, False, False, True, False, True])
False
>>> containsIncreasingWhitespaceSubsequence([True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False])

[Question]
        
You are given a matrix of n rows and m columns with each element as a positive integer. Two players take turns to play a game. In each turn, a player can select a non-empty list of elements from the matrix such that the sum of the selected elements is a positive integer. The player who selects the last element wins. Return true if the first player wins, otherwise return false.

Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
Output: True
Input: [[3, 2, 7], [1, 2, 1], [4, 1, 3]]

[Question]
        
You are given a list of odd natural numbers. You need to implement a function to find the reciprocals of the sum of the elements in each row of the triangular array formed by the numbers. The reciprocal should only be calculated for rows where the sum of the elements is greater than a given input value. If the reciprocal is greater than 0.5, return True; otherwise, False.

Given a positive integer N, the task is to check if its mirror image, when displayed in a seven segment display, is same as the number itself. Return True if the number is same after being mirrored and displayed in a seven segment display, otherwise return False.

For example, if the number is 86, its mirror image in a seven segment display will be 91. Therefore, the number and its mirror image are not the same.
