[Question]
        
Given an array of integers, the task is to split the array into two parts such that the sum of elements in each part forms the largest possible parallelogram. The largest parallelogram is formed by taking the sum of the two parts and multiplying the sum with the largest integer in the array. Find the maximum possible value of the largest parallelogram that can be formed.

Each element of the array can be multiplied by x if it is less than the element itself, and by y if it is greater than the element itself.

Find the maximum possible value of the array elements that can be achieved using the given capacity conditions.

Write a function `maxArrayValue` to solve the problem, which takes in the following parameters:
