[Question]
        
You are given an array of integers. Your task is to find the minimum number of swaps required to make the array such that no element is a multiple of any other element in the array. A swap is defined as switching the positions of two elements in the array.

For example, if the input array is [4, 3, 6, 8], the minimum number of swaps required is 2. One possible solution is to swap elements at indices 0 and 1 to get [3, 4, 6, 8], and then swap elements at indices 2 and 3 to get [3, 4, 8, 6].

[Question]
        
Given two positive integers `m` and `n`. Your task is to convert number `m` to `n` by dividing m with its factors or removing first occurrence of a digit from `m`. The result should be the minimum number of steps to reach `n`. If it is not possible to reach number n from m, return -1.

For example, to convert 30 to 45: 30 -> 15 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 45. 

Write a function to find the minimum number of steps to convert `m` to `n`.

Write a recursive function to calculate the number of divisions required to reduce a given number to 1 using the following rules:
- If the number is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, then the number is deemed ""poison"" and the function should return ""Not Possible"".
- If the number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5, the function should swap the number with the closest divisor (out of 2, 3, 5) that can reduce the number and call itself with the new number. The function should return the minimum number of divisions required.

Given a square matrix of binary values, the task is to minimize the number of flips needed to make each row and column have consecutive 1s, using bitwise XOR operations.

Write a function `minimizeFlips` to solve the problem, which takes in a square matrix of binary values and returns the minimum number of flips required.

[Question]
        
Given an array of binary numbers, write a function to perform a bitwise compression operation. The operation involves flipping the bits of each element in the array and then performing a Bitwise AND of each pair of adjacent elements to produce a new array. The task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to reach an array where all elements are 0.

[Question]
        
You are given an array consisting of n integers. The task is to make all the array elements equal to 0. You can do the following operation any number of times: choose some elements of the array and replace each element with the previous element. The cost of this operation depends on the number of equal adjacent elements, and equals to the number of operations - 1.

You are required to find the minimum cost to make all the array elements equal to 0.

Write a function minCostToMakeZero(arr: List[int]) that will take in one parameter:
- arr: a list of n integers (0 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= arr[i] <= 1000)
and will return the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal to 0.

You are given two arithmetic sequences, A and B, both of length N. The task is to find the least common element between the two sequences. 

An arithmetic sequence is represented as a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] is an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 2 between each two consecutive terms.

Write a function to determine the least common element between the two given arithmetic sequences.

[Question]
        
You are given indexed elements representing the positions of k disks on a 2D plane. The disks are opaque and have a slant height, and the goal is to connect the nodes with the left element using the Rotating Caliper technique to find the minimum distance between any two disks.

Write a function to find the minimum distance between any two disks on the plane.

The petrol stations are arranged in a circle. You can move in either direction, and starting from any station. The amount of petrol available at each station is also given in the same order. Find the minimum number of rotations needed to visit all the petrol stations and return the beginning station index.

Write a function to solve the problem using sliding window approach and return the minimum rotations needed along with the beginning station index.

You are given an array of integers where each integer represents the number of 1s in a specific row of a matrix. The array is not sorted. Write a function to find the minimum number of changes required to sort the array in ascending order. A change is defined as swapping two elements in the array.

You are given an array of percentages for lectures attended by a student in a given subject. The task is to find the minimum number of additional lectures the student must attend to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance for the subject. 

Write a function, named `minLecturesToAttend`, that takes in the array of percentages and returns the minimum number of additional lectures the student must attend.

[Question]
        
You are given an array where each element represents the maximum number of positions that can be moved in the forward direction from that element. You need to find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array. If an element is 0, then it's not possible to move through that element. Additionally, you are given a choice to either make a regular jump or a long jump by skipping a certain number of positions. Write a function to determine the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end, considering both regular and long jumps.

[Question]
        
You are given an array of integers. Write a function to determine the minimum number of clockwise rotations required to make the array a palindrome. If the array is already a palindrome, then the minimum number of rotations needed is 0. You are also required to compare the original array with the sorted array and return whether the original array and the sorted array are the same after the minimum rotations.

You are given a number N and you can perform the following operations on the number: 
	- Add 1 to the number 
	- Subtract 1 from the number 
	- Multiply the number by 2
Find the minimal number of operations required to make the number magical. A magical number is a number that becomes 0 after one or more operations as described above.

Write a function to calculate the minimal operations required to make the given number magical.

[Question]
        
Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of steps required to convert the array into a ""plus shape"". 

A plus shape is formed by taking the minimum of each group of adjacent elements and considering the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of these minimum values. Movement can only be performed to neighboring elements in the array.

Write a function to calculate and return the minimum number of steps required to achieve the plus shape.
