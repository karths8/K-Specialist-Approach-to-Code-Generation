Given a rooted tree with distinct products associated with each node, write a function to find the product of the deepest nodes in the tree. 

You are given a helper function to generate the spanning tree and the distinct products associated with each node. The tree is guaranteed to be a hexadecagonal tree.

Write a program to find and return the product of the deepest nodes in the given rooted tree.
