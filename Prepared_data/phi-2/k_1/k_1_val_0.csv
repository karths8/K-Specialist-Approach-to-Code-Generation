You are given the locations of water stations along a road and the distance between each pair of adjacent water stations represented as a list of integers. Each station can supply water to a specific radius. You need to compute the minimum radius required such that the arithmetic mean of the Manhattan distances between each station to the water stations it can reach is minimized. 

Write a function to calculate the minimum payment for this required radius. An active location which needs water is denoted by its index in the list of distances.

[Question]
        
In a sports competition, there are N players, and their workloads are represented in a lower triangular matrix where the entry (i, j) represents the workload difference between player i and player j. The workload difference represents the difference in the number of games player i plays against others and the number of games player j plays against others. You are required to determine if it is possible to make a series of swaps to achieve a zero workload difference for all players. Each swap involves swapping the workloads of two differentiable players such that the parity of the workload differences is preserved and no collisions occur.

Given a list of numbers, write a function to find and return a new list that contains the sum of the products of each overlapping pair of odd numbers in the original list.

For example, if the input list is [1, 3, 2, 5, 4], the pairs of odd numbers are (1, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 4). The sum of the product of these pairs would be (1*3) + (3*5) + (5*4).

Write a function to find the sum of products of each pair of odd numbers in the list and return a new list containing these sums.

The task is to find the period of the competition, which is defined as the number of adjacent pairs of scores[] having a decreasing trend. Write a function to calculate the probability of a participant having the maximum period of decreasing scores as compared to other participants.

Write a Python program to calculate the values of sin(x) and cos(x) using Taylor series expansion for an array of input values. Additionally, count the number of pairs of sin(x) and cos(x) values such that sin(x) * cos(x) is a Fibonomial number. A Fibonomial number is a number that can be expressed as the product of two Fibonacci numbers.

Given a number N, the task is to check if the number N is divisible by any of its digits. If any of its digits divides N completely, then return True, else return False. 

For example, if the number N is 128, since 1, 2, and 8 divides 128 completely, the output will be True.

[Question]
        
Given a grid of size N * M, where each cell in the grid represents the number of points gained by visiting that cell, the task is to calculate the maximum number of points that can be collected by two traversals permitted. The traversals start from the top-left corner and end at the bottom-right corner of the grid. The only restrictions are that the second traversal must start after the first and both traversals cannot intersect or visit the same cell at the same time.

You are given a rectangular page and the task is to find if it's possible to rotate the page by an angle. If the rotation results in a new rectangle's width being equal to the current rectangle's height and height equal to the current rectangle's width, return True, otherwise return False. 

Write a function that takes the width and height of the rectangle in its current orientation and the angle of rotation, and returns True if it's possible to rotate the page by the given angle, otherwise return False.
