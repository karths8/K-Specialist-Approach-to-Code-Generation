Return True if such a consecutive block exists and is a factor of the length of the binary representation, otherwise return False.

[Question]
        
You are given an array of integers representing the sides of Tetradecagonal scales. Your task is to implement a function to determine if it is possible to combine some or all of the scales to form a Tetradecagonal ring. The function should return True if it's possible, and False otherwise. You may use backtracking to solve this problem.

[Question]
        
In chess, Rooks can move in a straight line horizontally or vertically. Given the position of a Rook on a chessboard and a destination position, you need to determine if the Rook can reach the destination in a complete move, including any possible inversions.

Write a function canReachInCompleteMove that takes in the current position of the Rook and the destination position, and returns True if the Rook can reach the destination in a complete move, considering inversions, and False otherwise. The positions on the board are denoted by a string composed of a lowercase letter (a-h) followed by a digit (1-8), where the letter represents the column and the digit represents the row.

For example, given the current position ""a1"" and the destination ""a8"", the Rook can reach the destination in a complete move, so the function should return True.

[Question]
        
Given a sequence of numbers, write a function to check if the sequence forms a balanced sequence or not. A balanced sequence is a sequence in which the sum of the numbers on the left side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the right side after insertion of a perfect number at any position of the sequence.

The function should return True if the sequence can be balanced by inserting a perfect number at any position, and False otherwise.

You are given two lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a range. Write a function to determine if there is any overlap between the ranges of the two lists. The ranges are represented as tuples in the form (start, end), where start and end are integers and start <= end.

Write a program that takes in two lists of tuples and returns True if there is any overlap between the ranges of the two lists, otherwise return False.

In security systems, it's important to have monotonic sequences for grouped data to ensure a secure transfer. Given a list of Roman numeral sequences, write a function to determine if the list forms a monotonic sequence. Return True if the sequences are monotonic, and False otherwise.

[Question]
        
You are given a string representing a sequence of moves. You need to check if this sequence of moves forms a ""manhattan string"", which is defined as the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing at most one character from the given string. The moves in the string can include characters 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), and 'D' (down). Write a function to solve this problem.

Given a list of integers, each representing the number of stones in a pile, the task is to determine the winner of the Nim game. In the Nim game, two players take turns removing stones from the piles.

Given a rectangle represented by its bottom-left and top-right coordinates, and a point with coordinates (x, y), write a function to determine if the point is reachable from the root of the rectangle. The root of the rectangle is defined as the bottom-left vertex. The function should return a boolean value: True if the point is reachable, and False if it is not reachable from the root of the rectangle.

You are given an array ```arr``` of size ```N``` and a list of queries where each query contains an integer ```K```. For each query, you have to find whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array positive by flipping signs exactly ```K``` times. If it is possible, then return True else return False.

[Question]
        
You are given a list of positive numbers. The task is to write a function to find the minimum prime factor of the sum of the powers of unique elements in the list. If the minimum prime factor is less than or equal to a given positive number X, return True, otherwise return False.

For example, if the list is [2, 3, 5] and X=5, then the sum of powers of unique elements is 2^2 + 3^3 + 5^5 = 152, and the minimum prime factor of 152 is 2 which is less than or equal to 5.

[Question]
        
Write a function in Python to determine if two given strings are ""mountain"" or ""valley"" equivalent. Two strings are considered ""mountain"" or ""valley"" equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by performing any number of left or right rotations.

For example, the strings ""12345"" and ""54321"" are ""mountain"" equivalent because one can be obtained from the other by performing right rotations. Similarly, the strings ""12345"" and ""54321"" are also considered ""valley"" equivalent because one can be obtained from the other by performing left rotations.

Write a Python function that takes in two strings and returns True if they are ""mountain"" or ""valley"" equivalent, and False otherwise.

assert areMountainValleyEquivalent(""test"", ""best"") == False
assert areMountainValleyEquivalent(""abcdef"", ""efghij"") == False

Given a non-empty string in camel case, write a function to split the string into three non-empty substrings such that the sum of their ASCII values is the maximum possible. Return True if such a split is possible, otherwise return False.

For example, if the input string is ""HelloWorldInCamelCase"", a possible split into three substrings can be ""Hello"", ""World"", and ""InCamelCase"", and the function should return True.

You are given two integers N and K. The task is to represent the number N as a sum of K odd integers, and it is allowed to use repeated numbers. If this is possible, print ""Yes"" and the K odd numbers separated by a space. Otherwise, print ""No"".

For Example:
If N = 9 and K = 3, then the output will be ""Yes 1 3 5""

Write a function to solve the problem and return the expected output.
