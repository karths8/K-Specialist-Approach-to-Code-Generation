Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum possible by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is maximum and no two consecutive elements from the original array are in the same subarray (i.e., no consecutive elements can be in the same subarray after splitting). Return the maximum sum.

[Question]
        
You are given an array of integers A[], where A[i] is the price of a stock on the i-th day. You need to find the maximum possible sum of two numbers a and b such that they lie in the same subarray of A[] but don't have the same index and the absolute difference between their indices is also maximum. If there are no possible such numbers a and b, then return -1.

Create a function `maxPossibleSum` to solve the problem, where the function takes the list of integers `A`, and returns an integer representing the maximum possible sum based on the given conditions.

You are given an array of positive integers. Write a function to find the volume of the largest water-filled subarray, where the volume of water is calculated based on the negative difference between the heights of the left and right boundary of the subarray. You can assume that the array represents the heights of bars, and adjacent integers represent the width of each bar. Implement the function using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach.

Given an array of strings arr[], you need to find the maximum sum of ASCII values of characters of strings in the array. If a string contains any non-integer characters, consider their ASCII values as 0 and include them in the sum.

Write a function to merge two arrays of integers and return a new array containing the sum of elements at each index. If one of the arrays is shorter than the other, append the remaining elements of the longer array as is. Additionally, the function should filter out non-prime numbers from the result and return a set of unique prime numbers.

For input = [1, 4, 6, 8], [2, 3, 5, 7] the output should be {2, 3, 5, 7, 17}.
For input = [2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13, 17] the output should be {2, 3, 5, 31}.

[Question]
        
You are given an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The task is to find the maximum LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the values of nodes in each connected component in the graph. The value of a node is calculated as the sum of the values of all the nodes in the longest subarray of the connected component.

>>> maxLCM(4, 3, [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)], [1,0,2,3])
6
>>> maxLCM(3, 2, [(1,2),(2,3)], [3,2,1])
6
>>> maxLCM(3, 2, [(1,2),(2,3)], [1,2,3])
6
>>> maxLCM(4, 3, [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)], [1,0,2,3])

Given an array of integers, find the minimum possible difference between the maximum and minimum elements of all the subarrays of size K. If the difference of a subarray is the absolute value of the difference between its maximum and minimum elements, what is the minimum possible difference among all subarrays of size K?

Write a function that takes an array of integers and an integer K as input and returns the minimum possible difference among all subarrays of size K.

For input = [1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 15], 3 the output should be 2.
For input = [5, 3, 8, 10, 15], 3 the output should be 4.
For input = [5, 3, 8, 10, 15], 1 the output should be 0.

Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum using the Divide and Conquer approach. Implement the Square Root Decomposition method to solve this problem efficiently.

largestSumSubarray([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]) -> 7
largestSumSubarray([8, -5, 7, -3, 4, 2, -4, 6]) -> 1

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subarray with the equal number of even and odd integers.

For input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] the output should be 0.
For input = [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8] the output should be 8.
For input = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] the output should be 0.
For input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] the output should be 0.

generateGroups([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3) ➞ [
generateGroups([2, 3, 5, 7], 1) ➞ [[2], [3], [5], [7], [2, 3, 5, 7]]

Given a positive integer N and an array of distinct positive integers, the task is to find the sum of all elements of the array that are divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of the first N positive integers.

Write a function to find and return the sum of such elements.
