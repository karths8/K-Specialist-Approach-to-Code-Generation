assert reverseLevelOrder(root) == [[3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]] # Assuming binary tree root is defined
assert reverseLevelOrder(None) == []

assert maximumDistinctNodesCount([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)], 3, [(2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 3)]) == [2, 1, 2]
assert maximumDistinctNodesCount([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)], 2, [(5, 2), (4, 2)]) == [2, 2]

[Question]
        
You are given a binary tree where each node contains a value. You need to write a helper function to count the number of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at a given node which have a value greater than a given checkpoint value. Additionally, you have to increment the value of nodes at odd indices in the array by a given transaction fee.

[Question]
        
Squirrel Simulation: You are given two integers height and width representing a garden of size height x width. You are also given:

an array tree where tree = [treer, treec] is the position of the tree in the garden,
an array squirrel where squirrel = [squirrelr, squirrelc] is the position of the squirrel in the garden,
and an array nuts where nuts[i] = [nutir, nutic] is the position of the ith nut in the garden.
The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, to the adjacent cell.

Return the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one.

The distance is the number of moves.

Implement an algorithm to find the sum of all node values at a distance K from the target node value in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The distance is the number of edges between the nodes.

# Create a sample binary search tree
assert sumNodesAtDistanceK(root, 3, 2) == 14
assert sumNodesAtDistanceK(root, 8, 2) == 15
root = TreeNode(5, TreeNode(3, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(4)), TreeNode(8, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(9)))

Given a binary tree, write a recursive function to form a doubly linked list containing the leaves of the tree, preserving the order and the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent leaves should be an instance of the absolute-difference class.

leavesList = formLeavesLinkedList(root, float)
assert leavesList.next.data == 5

[Question]
        
Given an undirected graph with n vertices represented as an adjacency matrix and each vertex having a weight, your task is to implement an algorithm to find the maximum total value of weights for a given weight capacity W by using Prim's algorithm to identify the minimum spanning tree (MST) based on the weight-to-value ratio of the vertices.

assert maxTotalWeightPrimonacci([[0, 3, 1, 6, 0], [3, 0, 5, 0, 3], [1, 5, 0, 5, 6], [6, 0, 5, 0, 2], [0, 3, 6, 2, 0]], [2, 7, 3, 8, 4], 10) == 20

[Question]
        
You are given a positive integer N. The task is to construct a tree of N nodes such that the sum of nodes of all the root to leaf paths is not divisible by the count of nodes in that path. You need to return the constructed tree.

You are given a linked list. Write a function to insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list. Then, reverse the linked list and create a complete binary tree using the reversed linked list as the input. Finally, perform QuickSort on the keys of the nodes occurring in the incircle of the binary tree.

Given a binary string representing a binary tree, where '0' represents a leaf node and '1' represents an internal node, find the minimum index to flip to convert the binary tree to a full binary tree. A full binary tree is a binary tree in which each node has either 0 or 2 children.

[Question]
        
You are given a binary tree representing the solid structure of a building. Each node of the binary tree represents a column of the building, with the value of the node representing the height of the column. You need to find the maximum height of the building based on the given binary tree structure. 

Write a function to find the maximum height of the solid building represented by the given binary tree.

[Question]
        
You are given three integers n, d and k. The task is to construct a tree of n vertices such that the diameter of the tree is d and the maximum degree of any vertex in the tree is at most k. If it is not possible to construct such a tree, return an empty list.

For example, if the input is n = 6, d = 2, k = 3, the tree could be constructed as follows:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
     \
      6
```
As depicted in the above example, the tree has 6 vertices, a diameter of 2, and a maximum vertex degree of 3.

Write a function to construct such a tree or return an empty list if it is not possible.

[Question]
        
Given a quadrilateral represented as an array of integers, find the length of the longest path in the quadrilateral where the sum of the integers in the path is even, using dynamic programming and memoization. The quadrilateral can be represented as a tree, and the lowest common ancestor of any two vertices can be computed efficiently.

assert longestPathWithEvenSum([2, 3, 1, 5, 9, 4, 6], [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]]) == 4

You are tasked with implementing a system to prioritize and store weighted strings associated with friends in a social network. Each friend is represented as a TreeNode in a tree structure. The system should support the storage of infinite strings for each friend along with a priority associated with each string. Additionally, the system should be able to identify and store weighted strings within a hollow region of the tree. Define a proper fraction in this context.
