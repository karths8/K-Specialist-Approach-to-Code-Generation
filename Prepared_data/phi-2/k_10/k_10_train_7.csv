[Question]
        
Square Root Pattern: Given an integer n, generate the first n elements of the following pattern: 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, ...

The pattern starts with 0. The subsequent elements describe the previous element. For each number k, there are k occurrences of k in the sequence, followed by k+1 occurrences of k+1. For example, the first element is 0. The next element is 1, which is repeated 1 time. Then, 1 is repeated 2 times, followed by 2 repeated 1 time, and so on.

Write a function to generate the first n elements of this pattern.

For input = 10 the output should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2].
For input = 20 the output should be [.
For input = 1 the output should be [0].
For input = 15 the output should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3].

[Question]
        
You are given a list of integers, where each integer represents the coefficient of a term in a polynomial. Your task is to implement a function to convert this polynomial from one base, represented by a wildcard, to another base. The wildcard represents the base to be converted. The coefficients in the input list are to be interpreted as if their indices correspond to the powers of the base. The function should return a new list of coefficients representing the polynomial in the new base.

Write a function `convertBase` that takes in three parameters:
- A list of coefficients representing the original polynomial
- An integer representing the wildcard for the original base
- An integer representing the new base

convertBase([3, 2, 1, 0], 4, 2) == [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
convertBase([1, 2, 3], 2, 4) == [1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2]

You are given a grid of size N x N where each cell contains a number. You need to find the sum of all numbers in a range (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) such that the path from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) consists of non-intersecting paths and each cell in the path contains a prime number.

Input: [[2, 3, 5], [7, 11, 13], [17, 19, 23]], 0, 0, 2, 2
Output: 7
Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 0, 0, 2, 2
Output: 10
Input: [[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19]], 0, 0, 2, 2
Output: 41

Given two arrays A[] and B[] consisting of N and M integers respectively, the task is to calculate the sum of the nth terms of the modified Fibonacci series formed by pairing every element of A[] with every element of B[].

The modified Fibonacci series is formed as follows:
- The first two terms of the series are the two elements being paired.
- The subsequent terms are the sum of the previous pair's elements.

Write a function to calculate the sum of the nth terms of the modified Fibonacci series formed by pairing every element of A[] with every element of B[].

[Question]
        
Given a positive integer N, the task is to find the decimal equivalent of the concatenation of absolute difference of the floor and rounded value of the sequence of integers from 1 to N. The floor value of a number x is the largest integer that is less than or equal to x. The rounded value of a number x is the integer value closest to x.

For example, if N is 4, the sequence of absolute difference of floor and rounded value is:

|floor(1) - round(1)| = |1 - 1| = 0
|floor(2) - round(2)| = |2 - 2| = 0
|floor(3) - round(3)| = |3 - 3| = 0
|floor(4) - round(4)| = |4 - 4| = 0

The concatenation of these absolute differences is ""0000"", which is equivalent to the decimal value 0.

Write a function to compute the decimal equivalent for the given input N.

The server can only serve multiples of a given number, such that the served value is a rounded value based on the available multiples. Given a positive integer N, write a function to find the rounded value served by the server, considering only proper divisors of N on the right side of the list of divisors.

Use a selection sort to iterate through the array of numbers and swap elements to optimize the process. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

findPerfectNumbers(1, 100) returns [6, 28]
findPerfectNumbers(1, 1000) returns [6, 28, 496]

Write a function to find the sum of all sub-sequences of the given sequence modulo 10^9 + 7.

For input = [1, 2, 3] the output should be 38.
For input = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] the output should be 195.
For input = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] the output should be 1.

[Question]
        
You are given a list of integers and the task is to find the most frequently occurring prime number within a specified range in the list. You need to write a function that takes in a list of integers and a range, and returns the most frequently occurring prime number within that range. If there are no prime numbers within the range, return -1.

For Example,
- For the list [10, 11, 20, 11, 13, 13, 13, 20, 23, 24] and the range 10 to 20, the most frequently occurring prime number is 13.
- For the list [4, 6, 8, 9, 15, 21] and the range 10 to 20, there are no prime numbers within the range, so the output is -1.

An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive octagonal layers, similar to the pattern. The first few octagonal numbers are 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, 96...

[Question]
        
You are given a list of temperatures in a particular order. The temperatures represent the temperatures at different positions of a convex polygon. Your task is to find if there is any solution where the absolute differences of the temperatures taken in a zigzag manner result in a natural number or not. If there is no solution, return ""No Solution"", otherwise, return the first such solution found.

For example, given temperatures [3, 7, 2, 5], the zigzag differences are |3-7| = 4, |7-2| = 5, |2-5| = 3, and 4, 5, 3 are all natural numbers, so the solution would be (4, 5, 3).

Write a function to determine if there is a solution as described above. If there are multiple solutions, return the first one found.

[Question]
        
Given a number N, the task is to find a number formed by adding the product of its maximum and minimum digit K times.

For example:
If N = 35 and K = 3
Maximum digit = 5
Minimum digit = 3
Now, the new number is 35 + (5*3) + (5*3) + (5*3) = 35 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 80

Given a positive integer n, write a function to calculate the sum of factorials of the set bits in the binary representation of n.

sumFactorialSetBits(5)   # returns 2  # 5 in binary is 101, and sum of factorials of set bits is 1! + 0! + 1! = 2
sumFactorialSetBits(10)   # returns 1  # 10 in binary is 1010, and sum of factorials of set bits is 1! + 1! = 2
