"You are given a list of integers representing the value of coins. You are also given a list of boolean values indicating whether the coins should be flipped or not. If a coin should be flipped, you can switch its value from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Your task is to rearrange the coins in such a way that the maximum numeric value can be formed by considering the boolean list (if True, the coin value can be flipped, and if False, it cannot be flipped).

Write a function `max_possible_value(coins: List[int], can_flip: List[bool]) -> int` that takes in two lists `coins` and `can_flip` containing the values of coins and boolean indicators respectively, and returns the maximum possible numeric value that can be formed by rearranging the coins.

For example:

[Question]
        
You are given a list of integers representing the value of coins. You are also given a list of boolean values indicating whether the coins should be flipped or not. If a coin should be flipped, you can switch its value from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Your task is to rearrange the coins in such a way that the maximum numeric value can be formed by considering the boolean list (if True, the coin value can be flipped, and if False, it cannot be flipped).

Write a function `max_possible_value(coins: List[int], can_flip: List[bool]) -> int` that takes in two lists `coins` and `can_flip` containing the values of coins and boolean indicators respectively, and returns the maximum possible numeric value that can be formed by rearranging the coins.

For example:
- If `coins = [1, 0, 1, 1]` and `can_flip = [True, False, True, True]`, then the maximum numeric value that can be formed is 1110, so the function should return 1110.
- If `coins = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]` and `can_flip = [False, True, True, False, True]`, then the maximum numeric value that can be formed is 11100, so the function should return 11100.

[Question]
        
Given an array arr[] of n integers, the task is to find the maximum possible sum of products of the array elements with their respective indices. The array can be rotated to form different sequences.

For example, if the given array is arr[] = [8, 3, 1, 2], the maximum sum of i * arr[i] for any rotation of the array is 29, which is obtained by rotating the array to [3, 1, 2, 8].
