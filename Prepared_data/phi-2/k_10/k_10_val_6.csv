You are given an undirected tree with N nodes (1 to N). The tree is rooted at node 1. You have to find the maximum number of islands that can be created by removing exactly one node from the tree. An island is a set of nodes such that the sum of the sizes of all subtrees in the island is less than or equal to half of the size of the entire tree.
