Given an array arr[] of N integers and an integer M, the task is to find the Kth element of the array after M replacements. In each replacement, every element of the array is replaced by the XOR of the element with its adjacent element. Return -1 if the Kth element does not exist.

[Question]
        
You are given a list of positive integers and a target integer. Your task is to determine if it is possible to convert the list of positive integers to the target integer using the following operations:
1. Dividing an integer in the list with one of its factors.
2. Removing the first occurrence of a digit in the integer.
3. Reordering the integers in the list.

Write a function to determine if it is possible to convert the list of positive integers to the target integer using the given operations.
