The cyclic XOR padding involves XORing the integer values with a given key, and then padding the binary representations of the XORed values with leading zeroes to make their lengths equal.

Write a function to accomplish this task.

The input parameters are the root of the binary tree and a conditional function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value. The conditional function should be used to filter out node values before computing the level sum.

Write a function to solve the above problem using the given inputs and output format.

You are given a stream of n elements, and you are required to rank the elements as they arrive. The rank of an element is its position in the sorted array of all elements encountered so far (1-indexed) in descending order. Implement a data structure to efficiently track the ranks of the elements as they arrive.

Given the side length of a square, find the side length of the octagon inscribed within the square. The octagon has its vertices at the midpoint of the sides of the square.

Write a function `octagon_side_length` to find the side length of the octagon inscribed within the given square.

For example:

If the side length of the square is 10, then the side length of the octagon inscribed within the square is approximately 5.8577.
